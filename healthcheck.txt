To add a health check endpoint to your application, you need to modify your API server code.

Look for the file where you define your routes (probably src/api/mod.rs or src/api/server.rs) and add a simple health check endpoint:

```rust
// Add a root endpoint for health checks
app.route("/", get(|| async { "OK" }));
```

This will make your application respond with "OK" for GET requests to the root path, which Railway will use for health checks.

You might need to add this route before all your other routes to ensure it takes precedence.
